## Supported Devices

- LilyGo T-Deck (`tdeck`): keyboard + trackball + touch input, microSD config import/export, GPS, and full mesh UI support (channels, ANN, DMs, MAP, CFG, web config).
- LilyGo T-Lora Pager TFT (`tlora-pager-tft`): keyboard + roller wheel input, microSD config import/export, GPS, and full mesh UI support (channels, ANN, DMs, MAP, CFG, web config).
- M5Stack Cardputer + Cap LoRa/GPS (`cardputer-cap`): keyboard-driven input/navigation, microSD config import/export, GPS, and full mesh UI support (channels, ANN, DMs, MAP, CFG, web config).
- Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4 + TFT expansion kit (`heltec-v4`): touch-first UI, GPS, and full mesh UI support (channels, ANN, DMs, MAP, CFG, web config); microSD is not enabled in this profile.
- Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4 + TFT expansion kit, vertical UI (`heltec-v4-vertical`): same functionality as `heltec-v4` with a vertical-oriented UI layout.
- Attaky Mesh Deck (`mesh-deck`): keyboard + D-pad + touch input, GPS, and full mesh UI support; no microSD — config, DM history and the node archive live in internal flash.
- Elecrow ThinkNode M9 (`m9`): keyboard + d-pad input (no touch), microSD config import/export, GPS, and full mesh UI support (channels, ANN, DMs, MAP, CFG, web config). The only LR1110 board in the lineup.
- Square (`square`): bring-up target with a touch-first 320x240 UI, optional external BLE keyboard, ES8311 sound notifications, GNSS, browser VNC Host/Remote control, and 1-bit SD_MMC storage, including firmware config import/export at `/camillia/config.yaml`. LP5814 brightness, ADS1115 battery, audio, SD, BLE, and Remote support still need hardware verification. It is not published in releases yet.

Notes:
- All keyboard-specific shortcuts apply to keyboard builds (`tdeck`, `tlora-pager-tft`, `cardputer-cap`, `mesh-deck`, and `m9`).
- Environmental telemetry via BME280/BMP280/AHT20 is available on Heltec V4 expansion builds when a compatible sensor is present.

## Features

- **8 configurable LoRa channels** — each independently named, keyed, and color-coded
- **ANN tab** — read-only announcement feed (join/leave events, channel activity)
- **Web configuration** — browser-based settings UI, on by default, served over the device's own Wi-Fi AP or your network
- **YAML config** — import/export all settings and channel keys via microSD at `/camillia/config.yaml`

## First-Time Setup

On first boot, connect to the `camillia-mt` Wi-Fi access point, then open `http://192.168.4.1` in a browser. Set your node name, region, and channel keys. All settings are saved to the device and persist across reboots.

## Configuration

### Web config

Web config is enabled by default on a new device, so a freshly flashed board comes up as the `camillia-mt` access point. Connect to it and navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`. All settings (node identity, LoRa parameters, channel keys, etc.) can be configured here without reflashing. Changes persist across reboots.

Once the device joins your own Wi-Fi network it serves the full page — the same settings plus Utilities, a live feed, chat, and the node map — at the address shown on the Config screen. In access-point mode it serves **Web Config Lite**: the complete settings form without those extra tabs, which do not fit in the memory left once Wi-Fi is running. The Cardputer always serves Lite, and pauses chat while web config is on; see [USE.md](docs/USE.md#web-config).

The Config screen's **Choose WiFi** list includes an **AP** entry that forces the device's own access point even when a network is configured, so web config stays reachable out of range. That choice persists across reboots.

### SD card

Export or import a full YAML configuration file via the **CFG** tab. The file is read from and written to `/camillia/config.yaml` on the microSD card.

### CJK fallback

Text rendered through `emojiFont()` walks the chain **Montserrat → emoji → CJK**, so Chinese characters in node names, channel names, channel chat messages, DM previews, and DMs render inline alongside Latin and emoji without per-call-site handling. The CJK font is generated from [Noto Sans SC](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk) (SIL OFL 1.1) by `tools/gen_cjk_font.py`, which subs to the **top-1,500 frequency-ranked** Simplified-Chinese characters plus CJK punctuation and fullwidth forms (~0.30 MB flash after layout-table stripping; ~94-95% coverage of everyday text). Generated output lands in `src/fonts/cjk_font.h`.

The size cap is hard: every profile shares the same dual-OTA partition layout with 3.125 MB app slots, and the emoji font already leaves less than ~420 KB of headroom on the tightest boards. A 5,000-character subset compiles but overflows the linker's size gate on every board (measured: tdeck 119%, Cardputer 113%). Resubset if you want to expand or shrink the character set — rebuild alone is enough, no flash layout changes; see the tool's docstring for the commands and trade-offs. Regenerate with:

```bash
python3 tools/gen_cjk_font.py path/to/NotoSansSC-Regular.otf [N]
```

The script embeds the frequency-ranked top-2,000 characters; keep tdeck's worst case under ~97% of the 3,276,800-byte app slot when raising `N`.

## Releases

Releases are cut with [`release.sh`](release.sh), which builds every device
profile, merges factory images, signs the OTA images, tags the commit, and
publishes a GitHub release with the `.bin`/`.sig` assets. Debug symbols
(`.elf`/`.map`) stay in `dist/` on the release machine rather than bloating the
release by ~35MB per profile.

Pushing the tag also triggers [the build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml),
which compiles every environment from a clean checkout. It is a breakage check,
not a release gate — `release.sh` publishes before CI finishes — and it never
uploads release assets, since only the release machine holds the OTA signing
key.

```bash
./release.sh        # prompts for a version, e.g. 3.2.0
```

Publishes a release. On-device OTA and the website flasher both track GitHub's
*latest* release.


## Use of AI

Hello!  I've been a developer professionally since about 2001 working on a large list of technologies.  I've created this project in my spare time so I could contribute to my favorite new hobby (mesh networking) and try out coding with an AI partner (Claude).  Lots of this code has been touched by AI but as I go through the process I'm reviewing the code.  AI is tool, and like any other tool can be used well or used poorly.

This project is a bit more than a proof of concept but not something that has any commercial value.  I'm doing this for fun and to learn.  Feel free to contribute, use or ignore.
