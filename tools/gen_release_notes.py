"""Bakes RELEASE_NOTES.md into src/release_notes.h for the on-device viewer.

release.sh writes RELEASE_NOTES.md from the AI summary before it builds, so the
notes carried inside a firmware image are the same text published on the GitHub
release. Running as a pre: script means an edited RELEASE_NOTES.md needs no
separate step, and the header is only rewritten when the content actually
changes so a normal rebuild isn't forced every time.

Reads:  RELEASE_NOTES.md   (absent or empty is fine — the viewer says so)
Writes: src/release_notes.h
