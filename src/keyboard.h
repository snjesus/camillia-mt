// Both used to map to KEY_BACKSPACE, which made them impossible to tell apart
// downstream — Back deleted one character at a time and could not be given its
// own meaning. Compose treats this as "discard the draft and close"; every
// other consumer goes through isBackspaceKey(), which counts it, so Back
// behaves as it always did everywhere else.
//
// 0x91 rather than 0x90: the M9 driver already names raw 0x90 as a value it
// drops, and reusing the number for a mapped code invites confusing the two.

// CN/EN switch; everywhere else it is swallowed and ignored.
