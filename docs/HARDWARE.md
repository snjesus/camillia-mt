# Hardware Targets

Camillia has **seven distinct boards** across eight build envs (the two Heltec
envs are the same hardware, different UI orientation). The comparison table
below covers six of them. All share an
**ESP32-S3** SoC (dual-core Xtensa LX7 @ 240 MHz, 512 KB internal SRAM), the
`espressif32@7.0.1` / Arduino toolchain, and a **dual-slot OTA** flash layout —
two ~5 MB app partitions (`app0`/`app1`) on 16 MB boards + 64 KB NVS + 64 KB
coredump ([partitions.csv](../partitions.csv)); the 8 MB Cardputer uses
[partitions_cardputer.csv](../partitions_cardputer.csv) with 3.75 MB slots.
The table below captures what differs.

The Attaky Mesh Deck (`mesh-deck`) ships but is not yet in the comparison table; its
pin map is in [`src/hal/hw_mesh_deck.h`](../src/hal/hw_mesh_deck.h).

Specs are cross-checked against the manufacturers' sites (see [Sources](#sources))
and reconciled with each board's build config in [platformio.ini](../platformio.ini)
and its [`src/hal/hw_*.h`](../src/hal/) pin map.

> **Notes.**
> - **PSRAM/flash** are taken from the ESP32-S3 part number where the vendor lists it
>   (`FN16R8` = 16 MB flash + 8 MB octal PSRAM; `FN8` = 8 MB flash, no PSRAM;
>   `R2` = 2 MB PSRAM). The **Cardputer has no PSRAM**, which is why it carries the
>   tightest internal-DRAM budget for the LVGL pool and the TLS reserve that MQTT/OTA
>   need.
> - **GNSS:** LilyGo currently specs the u-blox **MIA-M10Q** on both the T-Deck and
>   Pager. Camillia parses any receiver as generic NMEA over UART, so the `L76K` label
>   in the HAL headers is just the driver — not a guarantee of the fitted chip, which
>   has varied across production batches.
> - **Heltec display:** the base V4 board ships a 0.96″ OLED that Camillia does not
>   use; the `heltec-v4` profiles target the ST7789 320×240 **TFT expansion**.
> - **Square bring-up:** the environment compiles, but no hardware subsystem is
>   considered verified without serial-log or measured evidence. LP5814 and
>   ADS1115 support now follows the upstream reference; SD_MMC is enabled in
>   one-bit mode, and the target stays out of release artifacts until hardware
>   checks pass.
> - **M9 radio:** the LR1110 is the one radio here that is not an SX126x, and the
>   differences reach the firmware — no DIO2-as-RF-switch, no current-limit or
>   RX-boost setters, `setIrqAction()` in place of `setDio1Action()`, and an
>   antenna switch the chip drives itself from DIO5/DIO6 that has to be given a
>   truth table (see [`hw_m9.h`](../src/hal/hw_m9.h), which carries the warning
>   attached to it). Elecrow lists the flash as "16GB"; the part is an
>   ESP32-S3**R8** with **16 MB**.
> - **Channel count:** ten configurable channels everywhere except the Cardputer,
>   which keeps eight — each channel owns a `MAX_MSG_LINES` history ring, and on
>   the only board without PSRAM those rings come out of internal DRAM. Nothing
>   on the air depends on the number: a Meshtastic header carries a channel hash,
>   not a slot index. See issue #44.
> - **Node table:** 250 entries everywhere except the Cardputer, which holds 50.
>   `NodeEntry` is 168 bytes, so a full table is ~41 KB, and the `MAX_NODES`-sized
>   index, snapshot and id arrays around it (the Nodes screen, the DM picker, and
>   the NVS save/load paths) add ~10 KB more — about 41 KB reclaimed in total by
>   the cut. On the boards with PSRAM that is free; on the only one without, it came
>   out of the same internal DRAM the SoftAP and the web-config page need, and a
>   failing 24-byte DMA allocation during an AP session is what it cost. The mesh
>   does not notice: the table is local bookkeeping about who has been heard
>   recently, not anything the protocol carries. Favorites are evicted last, which
>   is the mitigation to reach for on that board. See issue #49.
> - **M9 receive ceiling:** the LR11x0's `SetPacketParams` `PayloadLength` field
>   is both "bytes to transmit" and "largest payload the receiver will accept".
>   RadioLib writes the TX length there on every transmit and never restores it
>   for explicit-header RX, so after one transmission the radio silently refuses
>   anything longer than its own last packet — no interrupt, no error. All RX
>   arming goes through `MeshRadio::_armRx()`, which puts the ceiling back to 255
>   first; do not call `startReceive()` directly. The SX126x ignores this field
>   on RX, which is why only this board was affected. See issue #43.
> - **M9 packet reads:** the LR11x0 hands out its 256-byte RX buffer as a ring —
>   `GetRxBufferStatus` returns a start offset that advances a few bytes per
>   packet — so a packet that starts late enough has its tail wrapped to the base
>   of the buffer. RadioLib reads it as one linear run and loses the wrapped
>   part, which drops long packets while short ones sail through and moves the
>   cutoff around as the offset creeps. `MeshRadio::_readPacketLr11xx()` reads
>   across the wrap in two parts instead; see it and issue #43 for the full
>   diagnosis. This is why `mesh_radio.h` subclasses the RadioLib driver.
> - **M9 console:** this board brings the serial console out through an external
>   UART bridge rather than native USB-CDC, so its env builds with
>   `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=0`. With CDC on boot the logs go to a `ttyACM` port
>   the board does not expose and it looks silent. GPIO19/20 are the S3's USB
>   pads and this board reuses 20/21 for the keyboard bus, which is why the
>   keyboard driver has to release the ROM's pad claim first.
> - **M9 preproduction radios:** units shipping with LR1110 transceiver firmware
>   older than `0x0308` reject RadioLib's `DriveDiosInSleepMode`, which aborts
>   `begin()` with `-706` on a perfectly healthy radio.
>   [`tools/patch_radiolib_lr11x0.py`](../tools/patch_radiolib_lr11x0.py) patches
>   that tolerance into the `m9` env's own RadioLib copy at build time; on a fresh
>   checkout the first build may run before RadioLib is fetched, in which case it
>   warns and lands on the next build.

## Per-board HAL headers

Each board's full pin map and feature flags (`HAS_KEYBOARD`, `HAS_TOUCH`, `HAS_GPS`,
`HAS_SD_CARD`, LoRa/FEM pins, battery config, etc.) live in a dedicated HAL header:

| Board | HAL header |
| --- | --- |
| T-Deck | [`src/hal/hw_tdeck.h`](../src/hal/hw_tdeck.h) |
| T-LoRa Pager | [`src/hal/hw_tlora_pager.h`](../src/hal/hw_tlora_pager.h) |
| Cardputer + LoRa-1262 Cap | [`src/hal/hw_cardputer.h`](../src/hal/hw_cardputer.h) |
| Heltec V4 (expansion) | [`src/hal/hw_heltec_v4.h`](../src/hal/hw_heltec_v4.h) |
| Attaky Mesh Deck | [`src/hal/hw_mesh_deck.h`](../src/hal/hw_mesh_deck.h) |
| Elecrow ThinkNode M9 | [`src/hal/hw_m9.h`](../src/hal/hw_m9.h) |
